# 🍎 Mock Food Nutrition Database

This project provides a **mock food database** in JavaScript with nutritional values for common foods.  
It can be used for projects like:

- Diet planning apps 🥗  
- Calorie tracking systems 🔥  
- Fitness/nutrition dashboards 💪  
- Demo or testing purposes 🎯

## 📜 Database Overview

The `mockFoodDB` is a **JavaScript object** containing food items as keys, and their nutritional values (per 100g) as values.

Each entry has:
- `calories` (kcal)  
- `protein` (g)  
- `carbs` (g)  
- `fat` (g)  

Example:

```js
const mockFoodDB = {
  'apple': { calories: 52, protein: 0.3, carbs: 14, fat: 0.2 },
  'banana': { calories: 89, protein: 1.1, carbs: 23, fat: 0.3 },
  'chicken breast': { calories: 165, protein: 31, carbs: 0, fat: 3.6 },
  // ... more items
};

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add **serving size adjustments** (e.g., per piece, per cup, per slice).
* Expand to **100+ food items**.
* Provide **API endpoints** using Node.js / Express.
* Link to **real nutrition data** (USDA or other APIs).

👉 Do you want me to also **add usage examples in Node.js / Browser** (like `import` and `require`), so anyone can directly plug this into their project?
